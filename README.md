## What is GTML-E?

The Gas Turbine Modeling Library for Education (GTML-E) is an open source library intended for teaching the modeling and simulation of gas turbines. 

Development of the MATLAB/Simulink library was initiated on behalf of Tsinghua University to helps a student to learn how to create gas turbine models and related simulations.   

## Getting Started 

Stable releases of GTML-E are located under the <a href= "https://github.com/xjysb/GTML_E/releases" >releases tab</a>.
Note that GTML-E was developed in MATLAB/Simulink R2014a (The Mathworks, Inc.) and it is not guaranteed to work on earlier Matlab versions.

To install GTML-E in the Simulink Library Browser, simply add all folders and subfolders to the Matlab path using the set path option.

 SM changes unsmoothly, which dues to W changing too fast. We should introduce a Volume between Booster and Compressor.+ W - P_err-->
